# Generate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signals
Author: Irina Grigorescu, irinagry@gmail.com


A Python tool to generate MR signals based on multi-pulse sequences (either balanced or unbalanced).
My initial code was in MATLAB, this repository will contain that code but refactored in Python.
The reason for this is that people can use it to generate their own dictionaries of signals for a wide variety of multi-pulse sequences.
